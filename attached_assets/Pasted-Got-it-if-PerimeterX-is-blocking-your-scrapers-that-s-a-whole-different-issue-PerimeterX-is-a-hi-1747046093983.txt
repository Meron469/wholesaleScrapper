Got it â€” if PerimeterX is blocking your scrapers, thatâ€™s a whole different issue. PerimeterX is a high-level bot protection service used by sites like Zillow, Redfin, and OfferUp. It tracks:

Headless browsers (like Puppeteer or Selenium)

Fingerprints (screen size, fonts, timezone)

Mouse movement / click simulation

Behavior timing

ðŸ”¥ Hereâ€™s How to Bypass PerimeterX (What Actually Works):
âœ… 1. Use Stealth Plugins for Puppeteer/Selenium
For Puppeteer: use puppeteer-extra + puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install puppeteer-extra puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth
js
Copy
Edit
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer-extra');
const StealthPlugin = require('puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth');
puppeteer.use(StealthPlugin());
This removes many of the headless flags that PerimeterX checks.

âœ… 2. Rotate Residential Proxies (Not Datacenter)
Datacenter proxies get blocked almost instantly

Use residential rotating proxies from:

Smartproxy

Bright Data (Luminati)

Oxylabs

PacketStream (cheap option)

Set it to rotate every 1â€“5 requests.

âœ… 3. Simulate Human Behavior
Add real mouse movement, slight delays between typing, random scroll

Use page.mouse.move() and page.keyboard.type()
Donâ€™t just click() instantly

âœ… 4. Avoid Fast Repeats
Add random wait times between visits to Zillow or Redfin (e.g. 3â€“10 seconds)

If you're scraping 1,300/day, split into multiple small jobs (e.g. 100 every 30 minutes)

âœ… 5. (Advanced) Use Puppeteer with a Real Browser Profile
Launch Puppeteer using a real Chrome profile with cookies preloaded

Log in to Zillow manually once, reuse the cookie/session

js
Copy
Edit
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  headless: false,
  userDataDir: './your-profile',
});
ðŸ›‘ What Not to Do:
Donâ€™t run 24/7 without breaks

Donâ€™t use public proxies or Tor

Donâ€™t just use Axios or fetch â€” Zillow/Redfin will instantly block that

Final Answer:
Yes â€” PerimeterX is beatable, but you need to:

Run stealth mode

Use residential rotating proxies

Slow your scraper down

Simulate human actions

Rotate user agents and headers
